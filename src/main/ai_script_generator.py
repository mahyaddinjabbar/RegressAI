You are an expert Android QA automation engineer.

Using the following Android Activity and its XML layout file, generate comprehensive **Kotlin test cases** for regression testing using the **Espresso framework**.

### Requirements:
- The test cases must be executable Kotlin code using Espresso
- Use AndroidX imports
- Cover all critical UI interactions and edge cases
- Include tests for UI visibility, click actions, navigation, input validation, and dynamic content
- Include meaningful and concise comments
- Output should contain only the Kotlin code

### Activity file content:
